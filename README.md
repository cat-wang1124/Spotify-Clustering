Spotify playlists in increasing cluster size:
- K-means 
    - without PCA

This project is about using unsupervised machine learning techniques to create similar playlist clusters of Spotify songs. This shows 
the power of dimension reduction and clustering such as principal component analysis, k means, and mixture of gaussians. Run all the 
cells in order with your own client ID and client secret ID and you will be good to go. Questions can be directed to any of us!
